Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of designing,developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. 
It enables the development of software applications that power modern technology.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity
Mastering machines
mastering process

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - It defines the project goals of the software development
Design stage - This is where developers design how the software will look like
Development stage - The langauge used to develop the cycle
Testing stage - This is where the program is tested to ensure it works properly
Deployment stage - This is where the program is launched
Maintenance stage - This is where the program is well maintained and new features are added 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is like a linear flow, one step finishes before the next step starts while agile methadology is more flexible as it focuses on small rapid cycles.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer designs, codes, tests and maintains software applcations
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards and functions as intended, focusing on identifying and fixing issues before the software is released.
Project Manager oversees the entire software development process ensuring the project is completed on time.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software platforms that facilitate the creation of other software applications by providing space to write, compile and debug codes. It increases program productivity
VCS are software tools that help software teams manage to source code overtime. It aids with collaboration, error recovery, change tracking among others

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid technology advancement
software security
limited infrastructure
fatigue

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing involves testing individual functions of the software in isolation. It ensures each individual part of the software works in isolation.
Integration Testing involves  testing the interactions between different units of the software. It ensures the components work together as expected.
System Testing checks the software as a whole, ensuring that all components function correctly in the complete environment.
Acceptance Testing verifies that the software meets the business requirements and is ready for release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of giving instructions to AI to produce specific results.
Importance, users are able to ascertain the quality of the outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example of a vague prompt - "tell me something about space"
example of an improved prompt - "Tell me fun facts about the planets in our solar system!"
it is more effective because it is clear, specific and curious.
